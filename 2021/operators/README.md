## Controllers in Kubernetes

<!-- _class: lead-invert-purple -->

You tell Kubernetes what you want, and a controller makes it happen. ‚ú®

So you give the Kubernetes API this yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-website
spec:
  containers:
    - name: web-server
      image: nginx:latest
```

And a Pod Controller creates a Pod for you.

## an operator == a custom controller

An example: **wordpress-operator**

###### `github.com/bitpoke/wordpress-operator`

<br>

Instead of a `Pod`, you can create a `Wordpress` object:

```yaml
apiVersion: wordpress.presslabs.org/v1alpha1
kind: Wordpress
metadata:
  name: mysite
spec:
  replicas: 3
  domains:
    - example.com
  code:
    git:
      repository: https://github.com/example
```

And the Wordpress Operator makes it happen.

<!-- _class: default -->

The Wordpress Operator creates things like: 

- Deployments
- Pods
- ConfigMaps
- Services
- PersistentVolumeClaims

But what if you could create things outside of the Kubernetes cluster? ü§î

### Ordering pizza

#### `github.com/rudoi/cruster-api`

```yaml
apiVersion: alpha.rudeboy.io/v1
kind: PizzaOrder
metadata:
  name: my-order
spec:
  pizzas:
    - size: large
      toppings:
        - pepperoni
    - size: large
      toppings:
        - pepperoni
        - sausage
```

A more normal example: 

**ACK** (AWS Controllers for Kubernetes)

<br>
You can create a S3 bucket:

```yaml
apiVersion: s3.services.k8s.aws/v1alpha1
kind: Bucket
metadata:
  name: cat-pictures
spec:
  name: cat-pictures
```

# Pros:

- You can version your infrastructure along with your code.

# Cons / things to be aware of:

- Need to be able to trust the pull request process.
  - The CI/CD job to deploy the app to Kubernetes now has the power to create and destroy databases / instances / buckets.
- You can't make AWS / Azure / GCP permissions very specific.
  - People with commit access to the repo will be able to

My verdict: Trial

It really just depends on the quality of the operator. Love the concept though.
